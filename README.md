# lua-unit-converter
A small Lua unit conversion library, written by a junior high-schooler for a Discord bot.

Should support conversion between several types of units, including types of length, area, volume, weight and time. Also supports extracting numbers/units out of a string.

*May* have been inspired by https://akshayanandraut.github.io/api-unit-converter/.

No docs because I don't know how to do those (or at least, I don't know how to build docs out of code comments). There are some "docs" in the source.

Fun fact: I have absolutely no idea what I'm doing and this may not even work.
