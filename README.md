# lua-unit-converter

A small Lua unit conversion library, written by a junior high-schooler for a Discord bot.

This project was sparked by https://akshayanandraut.github.io/api-unit-converter/ (because it didn't work).


## Features

- Supports conversion of values between several types of units, including types of length, area, volume, weight and time.
- Also supports extracting numbers/units out of a string.


## Installation

Get it from [LuaRocks](https://luarocks.org):
```
luarocks install unit-converter
```


## Docs

No docs as of now because I don't know how to do those (or at least, I don't know how to build docs out of code comments). However, said comments should be fairly comprehensive for the time being.
